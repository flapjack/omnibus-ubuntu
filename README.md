# omnibus-ubuntu

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) images containing ubuntu, ruby, go, git, omnibus-ruby, omnibus-software, and omnibus-flapjack.

[omnibus-flapjack](https://github.com/flapjack/omnibus-flapjack) depends on the docker images created by this project to build packages for Ubuntu.

There's no reason you couldn't use this for building debs for other projects as well.
